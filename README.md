# homework2-responsivenessPortfolio

## Project Description
Use Bootstrap to build a portfolio app with appropriate responsiveness based on display size.

### General Notes
*Navbar obtained from bootstrap site and has working links to other pages. Chose to use justify-content-end to right-align the links but that causes problems with centering the links on a small screen.
*Tried for the sticky footer but could not get it to stick to the bottom of the page. Left it active on Contact page, but commented it out on About Me and Portfolio pages as it was distracting.

### Page specific: About Me (aka index.html)
*ContentSection uses a float on the image to get the following paragraph to wrap around the side and bottom of the image (when enough text exists)

### Page specific: Contact
*Form obtained from bootstrap site.

### Page specific: Portfolio
*Card obtained from bootstrap site. Tried to make the h5/card-title overlay object stretch across the image and show at the bottom but was not successful.

## Project Details
Use Bootstrap to build a portfolio app with appropriate responsiveness based on display size.

## Requirements 
    * (copied from Homework instructional README.md, for reference)

### Directions
* Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.
* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
    * A navbar
    * A responsive layout
    * Responsive images
* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

### Hints
* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).
* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. 
* On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

### Minimum Requirements
* Functional, deployed application
* GitHub repository with README describing the project

### Bonus
* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
